# The pile

* Schematic/decoration system modularisation/de-duplication
	* QA Block schematic checks?
	* Highly Reproducible schematic mode - sets all probabilities to 255.
	Useful for comparing map renders to further reduce diff noise.
	* Log schematics de-duplication & as MTS
	* Grass and other decoration placement de-duplication (moss, ferns, mushrooms etc)
	* Woodship schematic as MTS
	* U-boat schematic as MTS
* ABMs: Conversion to LBMs or nodetimers where appropriate, especially shipwrecks
	* Kelp
		* Giant Brown kelp
			* Knocking out the stem does not knock out the upper
			* Nerf growth rate (move to nodetimer), it's too fast otherwise
			* but try to make it appear in full size at worldgen time.
			* Craft kelp-stone with 8 kelp + 1 stone
		* Investigate edibility of other species
	* Aquatic ABMS: Idle 28-33% Minetest before any changes
* Bonemeal support:
	* Growth requirement to be scaled per tree so that mulch is not a positive 
	feedback loop or break-even by default, then configurable multiplier.
* Tree Schematics with no sapling:
	* Small river oak (river_oak_small_tree)
	* Small Coast Banksia
	*
	* Just accept it as limited supply OR
	* Register separate sapling, random drop OR
	* Register separate sapling, separate leaves OR
	* Random choice of river oaks upon sapling growth OR
	* Different schematic sets in different soils
* Reproduction of smaller plants like spinifex, mitchell grass
	* Bonemeal addon?
	* Cultivation item(s)?
* Internationalise strings
* Move schematics to subdirectory to avoid potential name clashes
* Make submarines not exceedingly rare
	* Murray-darling spawn (holbrook)?
